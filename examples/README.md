====================

You can download and play with these notebooks to get a feeling for how ``rouse`` works. If you don't want to run them yourself, you can also consult the [examples page](https://rouse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) of the documentation.

--------------
When writing example notebooks, make sure to remove the output cells before adding them to the repo. This ensures good readability of diffs!
