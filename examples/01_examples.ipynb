A free chain of $N$ monomers therefore has one degree of freedom (the center of mass location) that does not equilibrate, while the remaining $N-1$ degrees of freedom (sometimes called \"Rouse modes\") are internal and equilibrate in a finite time. When calculating the \"steady state\" for a free chain then, what we really would like to do is to get the steady state for all internal degrees of freedom and pin the center of mass to some fixed point in space.

    "Note the return values of ``steady_state()``: while the mean conformation ``M``, carries the correct number of spatial dimensions (it is an ``N x d`` array) we only get an ``N x N`` covariance matrix, instead of the ``(Nd) x (Nd)`` matrix that we should get in full generality for ``N`` monomers in ``d`` spatial dimensions. This is technically a simplification that this implementation of the Rouse model makes, but a very fair one at that: under the Rouse model, the spatial dimensions fully decouple; as long as they are uncorrelated in the initial conditions, they will remain independent going forward. You can, however, use separate covariance matrices ``C`` for the different spatial dimensions. In this case, use [propagate_C()](../rouse.rst#rouse.Model.propagate_C) and [propagate_M()](../rouse.rst#rouse.Model.propagate_M) to propagate mean and covariance separately. (The evolution equations for ``M`` and ``C`` are independent; ``propagate()`` is just a convenience function calling both ``propagate_M()`` and ``propagate_C()`` in succession)."
